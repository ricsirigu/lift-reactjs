### A simple SPA with Lift 3 roundtrips and Facebook's ReactJs 

...Roundtrips?

With Lift 3, we introduce the idea of Round Trips: a client-side request that's sent to the server where the client receives a Streaming Promise, the server performs its computations and when the results are ready, they get pushed to the clientâ€¦ and if there are multiple results, the multiple results are pushed to the client as the results become available.
