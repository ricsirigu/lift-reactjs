### A simple SPA with Lift 3 roundtrips and Facebook's React 16

...Roundtrips?

With Lift 3, we introduce the idea of Round Trips: a client-side request that's sent to the server where the client receives a Streaming Promise, the server performs its computations and when the results are ready, they get pushed to the clientâ€¦ and if there are multiple results, the multiple results are pushed to the client as the results become available.

### How to run

You need to have installed NodeJs and npm on your machine

Run sbt and type `cs` to start the Lift backend

Type `npm i` to download all the dependencies

Type `npm run watch` on your terminal to launch nodejs and webpack

Go to `localhost:8080`

Enjoy
